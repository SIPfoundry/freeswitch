freeswitch (1.0.head~git.master.20100601.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Various trivial changes and updates.
  * Change upstream package version numbering scheme for unreleased versions:
    new format is major.minor.micro~git.branch.date.commits-1
  * Change source format to 3.0 (quilt).
  * Upgrade debhelper compatibility to version 7.
  * Update maintainer data and copyright file; now includes the full text
    of the MPL since it is not (yet?) available in /usr/share/common-licenses/

  * Build and install mod_file_string.so (FSBUILD-247)
  * Work around build failure caused by clean rules for openzap.

  * Remove several libraries from explicit dependencies, there were no special
    version requirements and they should be picked up by dh_shlibdeps.
  * Add dh_makeshlibs and make dh_shlibsdeps work again.
  * Move openssl to Suggests: as it is not a required package to install or
    run freeswitch.

  * Add upstream-convert rule to apply patches, generate orig tarball
    and set package version.
  * Add check to ensure debian patches are applied before attempting build.
  * Fix clean rule to avoid unwanted tree change before building orig.tar
    archives with git-buildpackage.
