Package: freeswitch-freetdm
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, freeswitch
Description: FreeTDM is a signaling and board API abstraction used mainly by the
 FreeSWITCH project to place calls in TDM and analog telephony circuits. The library
 was previously named "OpenZAP". Sangoma has worked along with the FreeSWITCH
 developers in this library so Sangoma's customers can also use it to do custom
 development. The library is still under heavy development but the overall API
 does not change often. The intention of the library is to present a consistent
 API for different telephony signaling stacks and board I/O APIs.  FreeTDM can
 either be used as a standalone API or along with FreeSWITCH as an endpoint
 (mod_freetdm). If you want to use it as a part of FreeSWITCH remember following
 the FreeSWITCH configuration section.
 This package contains all the freetdm modules and libs and submodules
