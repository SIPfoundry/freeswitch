<a name="First_considerations" id="First_considerations"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> First considerations </span></h1>
<p>This document covers information about the <i>Endpoint</i> of Khomp as a whole, include the options, <i>applications</i>, <b>CLI</b> commands, among others.
</p><p>For first installation procedures, please see the <a href=".htmlMod_Khomp/README/en" title="Mod Khomp/README/en">README</a>.
<br />
</p>
<a name="Configuration" id="Configuration"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Configuration </span></h1>
<p>Configuring the Khomp Endpoint is a task that consists of three steps:
</p>
<ul><li> Configuration of the boards through the K3L;
</li><li> Setting up the Endpoint;
</li><li> Setting up the FreeSWITCH.
</li></ul>
<p>These steps are described more fully below.
<br />
</p>
<a name="K3L_API_Configuration" id="K3L_API_Configuration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> K3L API Configuration </span></h2>
<p>This step is carried out in a semi-automated way using the <b>khompwizard</b> program, a wizard that configures the basic parameters of the system boards. This wizard initializes the configuration files using information from the user when they are needed, initializing the standard settings to default values.
</p><p>Typically, this program runs automatically after installation of the system. However, you may need to run it manually if an update is being performed, or if new cards were added to the system after installing new drivers.
</p><p><br />
If you need to set advanced parameters of the board and/or signaling, the program <b>k3lconfig</b> allows you to access all the available settings for each installed card. For more information about this program, check the <b><a href="http://169.254.1.3/kdevwiki/wikidocs/index.php?title=K3lconfig_-_User%27s_Guide&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="K3lconfig - User&#39;s Guide (página não existe)">k3lconfig User's Guide</a></b>. For solving synchronization issues, check the <a href="#Troubleshooting" title="">Troubleshooting</a> section for manual configuration of the boards.

</p>
<a name=".3Cgroups.3E" id=".3Cgroups.3E"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> &lt;groups&gt; </span></h4>
<p>Defines the groups to be used in channel allocation.
</p><p>In this case, the options are used to define names for <i>strings allocation of channels</i>. The format follows the standard <b>&lt;group name&gt; = &lt;allocation string&gt;</b>, where the <b>allocation string</b> is the same string used in the bridge application, and <b>group name</b> is an arbitrary name chosen by the user.
</p>
<dl><dd>For example, to define the group <b>pstn</b> as the channels 0 and 5 of the board 0, the following line could be used:
</dd></dl>
<pre>&lt;param name="pstn" value="b0c0 + b0c5"/&gt; 
</pre>
<p>This group, in turn, could be used in the <i>bridge application</i> as <b>&lt;action application="bridge" data="Khomp/Gpstn/..."/&gt;</b>.
</p>
<dl><dd>You can associate a given input context to a channel group, simply specify a name of context string after the allocation, separated by ':'.
</dd></dl>
<p>For example, to define the same group <b>pstn</b> as channels 0 to 20 of card 0, and defining the incoming context to for channels in this groups to <b>from-pstn</b>, one could use the line:
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="pstn" value="b0c0-20:from-pstn"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>This group would be used the same way as before in the <i>bridge application</i>, and all the calls coming from these channels would be treated in context <b>from-pstn</b>.
<br />
</p>
<a name=".3Ccadences.3E" id=".3Ccadences.3E"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> &lt;cadences&gt; </span></h4>
<p>Defines settings for the Endpoint cadences.
</p><p>In this case, the options are names cadences, followed by one or two pairs of numbers - that define the ranges of tone and silence to be used in cadences.
For details, please refer to the configuration file for examples.
<br />
</p>
<a name=".3Cfxs-branches.3E" id=".3Cfxs-branches.3E"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> &lt;fxs-branches&gt; </span></h4>
<p>Defines source numbers for the board KFXS.
</p><p>In this case, the options are sequences of prefixes of branches and serial numbers of the boards, which define the basic numbers of source addresses, and the numerical order of the boards. The format of the options is:
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="prefixo" value="serial1, serial2, ...."/&gt;
</pre>
<p>For example, if two <b>KFXS-300 SPX</b> boards with serial numbers <b>K0374</b> and <b>K2352</b> must be numbered sequentially, starting from branch 200, you may write:
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="200" value="374, 2352"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>This will define the first branch of board '<i>K0374</i> as number 200, the second as 201, and so one. The first branch from board K2352 will have number 230 (as K0374 has 30 channels), the second will be numbered 231, and so on - until the last channel, numbered 259.
</p><p>For more details, please refer to the configuration file for other exemples.
<br />
</p>
<a name=".3Cfxs-hotlines.3E" id=".3Cfxs-hotlines.3E"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> &lt;fxs-hotlines&gt; </span></h4>
<p>Sets hotlines for the KFXS based boards
</p><p>In this case, the options are sequences of branches and sequences of destination numbers, which define branches to be treated as "hotlines" and numbers to be dialed when they are take off hook. For instance:
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="100" value="1234"/&gt;
&lt;param name="200" value="4321"/&gt; 
</pre>
<p>In the first line, the branch numbered 100 will call extension 1234 when taken off hook, while in the second one, branch 200 will call number 4321 when taken off hook.
<br />
</p>
<a name=".3Cfxs-options.3E" id=".3Cfxs-options.3E"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> &lt;fxs-options&gt; </span></h4>
<p>Allows you to set specific settings for FXS extension.
</p><p>In this case, the settings are extension numbers (based on those defined in the <b>&lt;fxs-branches&gt;</b>), and the options and their values.
</p>
<ul><li>context; 
</li><li>input-volume; 
</li><li>output-volume; 
</li><li>calleridnum; 
</li><li>calleridname;
</li><li>language;
</li><li>accountcode;
</li><li>flash-to-digits.
</li></ul>
<p>Each option is separated from each other by a pipe "|" or a slash "/" and defined after the colon ":". Example:
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="200" value="input-volume:1|context:master-branch" /&gt;
</pre>

<a name="FreeSWITCH_Configuration" id="FreeSWITCH_Configuration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> FreeSWITCH Configuration </span></h2>
<p>When connections are received on the boards and devices Khomp, they are forwarded by the <i>Endpoint</i> to specific contexts within the dialplan of FreeSWITCH&reg;. These settings can be changed via the configuration file <b>khomp.conf.xml</b>, available on the FreeSWITCH configuration directory (by default, "<b>/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs</b>").
</p><p>For details about the specific contexts, see section <a href="#Endpoint_Configuration" title="">Endpoint configuration</a>.
</p><p>Below are details of how to configure the settings for incoming calls
<br />
</p><p><br />
</p>
<a name="Contexts_for_E1_channels" id="Contexts_for_E1_channels"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Contexts for E1 channels </span></h3>
<p>For E1 boards, inbound contexts are predefined as option <b>context-digital</b> with default value as following:
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="context-digital" value="khomp-DD-LL"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>This standard defines the context that links will be redirected in accordance with the number of the board and number of the link: <b>DD</b> is the device number (two digits), and <b>LL</b> is the number of the link (also with two digits).
</p><p>However, it is possible to configure other inbound contexts, with different formats. There is format <b>CCC</b>, which means the channel number on the card (three digits), and <b>SSSS</b>, which represents the serial board number (with four digits).
</p><p>Examples for configuration entries (<b>khomp.conf.xml</b>):
</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- Serial board number and sequential link (ex: khomp-01-00) --&gt;
&lt;param name="context-digital" value="khomp-DD-LL"/&gt;
</pre>
<pre>&lt;!-- Serial board number and sequential link (ex: khomp-3049-00) --&gt;
&lt;param name="context-digital" value="khomp-SSSS-LL"/&gt;
</pre>
<pre>&lt;!-- Sequential board number and the channel (ex: khomp-00-001) --&gt;
&lt;param name="context-digital" value="khomp-DD-CCC"/&gt;
</pre>
<pre>&lt;!-- Receive all calls in one context (khomp-digital) --&gt;
&lt;param name="context-digital" value="khomp-digital"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>Follows an example the context usage inside the dialplan:
<!-- NEED 6 -->
</p>
<pre>&lt;!--
The present context in 'extensions.conf' will handle calls
that come from the link 0 (first link) of the board 0.
--&gt;
&lt;context name="khomp-00-00"&gt;
             .
             .
             .
&lt;/context&gt;
</pre>
<p>Another example, using the same format:
<!-- NEED 6 -->
</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- 
The present context in 'extensions.conf' will handle calls
that come from the link 1 (second link) of the board 0.
--&gt;
&lt;context name="khomp-00-01&gt;
             .
             .
             .
&lt;/context&gt;
</pre>
<p>A complete example, with a few simple actions:
<!-- NEED 10 -->
</p>
<pre>&lt;context name="khomp-00-00"&gt;
    &lt;extension name="exemplo_1"&gt;
        &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^1234$"&gt;
            &lt;action application="bridge" data="Khomp/b0L1/2345"/&gt;
        &lt;/condition&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension name="exemplo_2"&gt;
        &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^23(\d{2})$"&gt;
            &lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/${use_profile}/11$1@${sip_from_host}"/&gt;
        &lt;/condition&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/context&gt;
</pre>
<pre>&lt;context name="khomp-00-01"&gt;
    &lt;extension name="exemplo_3"&gt;
        &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^1111$"&gt;
            &lt;action application="bridge" data="Khomp/b0L0/2345"/&gt;
        &lt;/condition&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/context&gt;
</pre>
<p>This dialplan defines that:
</p>
<ol><li> The incoming calls on the link <b>0</b> of the board <b>0</b> will have the following handling:
<ul><li> Calls to the extension 1234 for will be redirected to the second link on the first board (b0L1), calling number <b>2345</b>;
</li><li> Calls to any four digit number starting with<b>23</b> will be redirected to SIP phones numbered <b>11</b> plus the last two digits of the number dialed.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The incoming calls on the link <b>1</b> of the board <b>0</b> for the number <b>1111</b> will be redirected to the first link of the first board (b0L0) calling number <b>2345</b>.
</li></ol>

<p>Just as in the context of E1 cards, inbound links are forwarded to the Endpoint FreeSwitch. 
</p><p>The context is pre-defined as follows, according to the file <b>khomp.conf.xml</b>:
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="context-gsm" value="khomp-DD-CC"/&gt;&nbsp;;placas GSM
</pre>
<pre>&lt;param name="context-fxs" value="khomp-DD-CC"/&gt;&nbsp;; placas FXS
</pre>
<pre>&lt;param name="context-fxo" value="khomp-DD-CC"/&gt;&nbsp;; placas FXO
</pre>
<p>For these options, <b>DD</b> is the device number (two digits), and <b>CC</b> is the channel number (also two digits). There is also the <b>SSSS</b> format, which represents the serial number board.
</p>
<ul><li><b>NOTE</b>: In the <b>KGSM</b> board, incoming calls are <b>always</b> redirected to the <b>"s"</b> extension, since the GSM protocol does not identify the target number, only the originator - if not omitted.
</li></ul>
<a name="Priority_settings_on_the_FXS_branches" id="Priority_settings_on_the_FXS_branches"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Priority settings on the FXS branches </span></h4>
<p>On calls originated from an FXS branch, the Endpoint searches for a valid extension (digits sent) after the DTMF <b>#</b> or after the <i>timeout</i> (option <b>fxs-digit-timeout</b>). That search is done in the context defined in section <b>&lt;fxs-options&gt;</b>, or if no context configured, the search is done in context defined in <b>context-fxs</b>.

<a name="Contexts_for_SMS_messages_.28GSM_only.29" id="Contexts_for_SMS_messages_.28GSM_only.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Contexts for SMS messages (GSM only) </span></h3>
<p>SMS messages are received by the Khomp <i>Endpoint</i> and forwarded to FreeSWITCH as a normal connection but no audio, which has some variables set with information received in the message - for more information on these variables, see the documentation of the variables of the <i>Endpoint</i>. This context can also be modified in the same way as the above contexts.
</p><p>The default value for this option follows (<b>khomp.conf.xml</b>):
</p>
<pre>&lt;param name="context-gsm-sms" value="khomp-sms-DD-CC"/&gt; 
</pre>
<p>Where <b>DD</b> is the device number (two digits), and <b>CC</b> is the channel number (also with two digits). For example:
</p>
<pre>&lt;context name="khomp-sms-00-01"&gt;
    &lt;extension name="sms"&gt;
        &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^s$"&gt;

</li></ul>
<p>The capitalization of the letter 'B', 'S' or 'R' defines the search order of the channels: if capitalized, order is descending; otherwise, ascending.
</p><p>As for the allocation of channels across groups, the following syntax is available:
</p>
<ul><li> ggroupname - uses the string defined the group "groupname" in the configuration file (detailed in the configuration section of the Endpoint).
</li><li> Ggroupname - equivalent to the above.

<a name="Grouping_channel_allocations" id="Grouping_channel_allocations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Grouping channel allocations </span></h3>
<p>There are cases where you need to get more channels for a particular device or particular group of extensions. For this, there is an extension available in string allocation, with respect to the use of token sum (<b>+</b>) to concatenate multiple strings<i>binding</i>, as follows:
<!-- NEED 6 --> 
</p>
<pre>&lt;action application="bridge" data="Khomp/B1L0+B2L0/32332933"/&gt;
&lt;action application="bridge" data="Khomp/*B2+B3+B4/99887766"/&gt;
&lt;action application="bridge" data="Khomp/S0411+B1L0/99887766"/&gt;

&lt;action application="bridge" data="Khomp/*gOperadora1+gOperadora2/98891234"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>This grouping is available for the <i>application</i> <b>bridge</b> and on the specification of groups. The processing of allocation takes place from left to right - except when using cyclic channel allocation, where<b>all</b> the specified channels are scanned simultaneously.
</p>
<a name="Cyclical_and.2For_fair_allocation" id="Cyclical_and.2For_fair_allocation"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Cyclical and/or <i>fair</i> allocation </span></h4>
<p>Another way for allocation of channels is the cyclic and/or <i>fair</i> allocation, which chooses the channel that has <b>completed</b> the the lowest number of <b>outgoing</b> calls. This mode of allocation may be used by passing an asterisk (<b>*</b>) before the allocation string of channels (as can be seen in the section above, in the second and fifth examples).
</p><p>When started with an asterisk (<b>*</b>), other forms of allocation (increasing, decreasing, etc) are used to decide what channel will be allocated when there are two or more channels with less number of outgoing calls.
</p>
<ul><li><b>WARNING: The use of fair and/or cyclic is recommended <u>only</u> for analog (KFXO), branches (KFXS) and cellular interface (KGSM) boards</b>. E1 connections should allocate channels in one way (ascending/descending) from one side and the opposite on the other to avoid problems of double seizure (which may occur in R2/MFC signaling). Fair/cyclic allocation also costs more in memory and processor footprint, which tends to be a higher cost in E1 due to the higher number of channels (30 in each link).<br /><br /> For these reasons, fair/cyclic allocations should only be used on signalizations where it can represent any real difference, like equalizing the charge costs of the lines, the total usage, or the number of connections received by each branch.

<a name="Description_of_variables" id="Description_of_variables"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Description of variables </span></h3>
<p>Below, follows an explanation on how to use variables of Khomp Endpoint in the dialplan, to communicate and/or to receive information:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<a name="KDropCollectCall" id="KDropCollectCall"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> KDropCollectCall </span></h4>
<p>When activated, causes the Endpoint to drop Khomp collect calls through dual service (available for signaling 'R2 Digital' and FXO), through information available on the ISDN protocol and R2/MFC, or by detecting the audio call collect (available for any digital signage for E1, and GSM signaling).
</p><p>This variable is useful to filter collect calls to certain extensions, and <b>must</b> be set before making any type of answer - applications such as <b>playback</b> and <b>bridge</b> should always be executed after setting this variable, for example.
</p><p>For better functionality, is also recommended that no call status (<i>ringback</i>) is sent before this variable is set, so applications should be performed only after the correct setting of this variable.
</p><p>This variable can be set locally and globally, both to <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>. The adjustment of global variable to <b>yes</b> will drop all the collect calls, unless the particular call is set to <b>no</b> - this allows the creation of a global filter of collect calls, with few exceptions.
</p><p>Enabling the variable in context <b>default</b>:
</p><p><!-- NEED 5 -->
&lt;context name="default"&gt;
</p>
<pre>&lt;extension name="example"&gt;
 .
 .
 .
 &lt;action aplication="set" data="KDropCollectCall=yes"/&gt;
 .
 .
 .
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>
<p>&lt;/context&gt;
</p><p>Enabling the variable in the global context, remembering that it must be configured in the file <b>vars.xml</b>:
<!-- NEED 5 --> 
</p>
<pre>&lt;X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="KDropCollectCall=yes"/&gt;
</pre>
<a name="KR2SendCondition" id="KR2SendCondition"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> KR2SendCondition </span></h4>
<p>When you receive a call, can be set before sending ringback by FreeSWITCH (ie, before the run FreeSWITCH applications <b>answer</b>, <b>bridge</b>). When used in signaling R2/MFC, this variable sets the condition for B to the numeric value desired.
</p><p>Exemplo:
<!-- NEED 6 --> 
</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- Condition "NUMBER CHANGED" warns the caller that the number of B has changed. --&gt;
&lt;action application="KR2SendCondition" data="3"/&gt;
</pre>
<a name="KR2GotCategory" id="KR2GotCategory"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> KR2GotCategory </span></h4>
<p>When you receive a call, is set by the Endpoint with the category received from the number that originated the call. It is set in signaling R2/MFC, and can be found anywhere in the dialplan.
</p><p>Example:
<!-- NEED 3 --> 
</p>
<pre>&lt;action application="log" data="DEBUG KR2GotCategory [${KR2GotCategory}]"/&gt;
</pre>
<a name="KR2GotCondition" id="KR2GotCondition"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> KR2GotCondition </span></h4>
<p>Variable adjusted by the Endpoint, and available after returning from a call made by FreeSWITCH. Has the condition of B received when making the call. Available only for signaling R2/MFC.
</p><p>Example:
<!-- NEED 3 --> 
</p>
<pre>&lt;action application="log" data="DEBUG KR2GotCondition [${KR2GotCondition}]"/&gt;
</pre>
<a name="KUserInfoDescriptor" id="KUserInfoDescriptor"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> KUserInfoDescriptor </span></h4>
<p>Variable adjusted by the Endpoint in the context of entry, from information received by the ISDN network functionality through user-to-User Information. Contains the descriptor number of the protocol used by the other end, and usually contains the value '0 ', but this is dependent on application.
</p><p>For further information, consult the specification ITU-T Q931 (more precisely, the specification table 4-26).
</p><p>Example (working with the descriptor number of the protocol):
<!-- NEED 3 --> 
</p>
<pre>&lt;action application="log" data="DEBUG KUserInfoDescriptor [${KUserInfoDescriptor}]"/&gt;
</pre>
<a name="KUserInfoData" id="KUserInfoData"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> KUserInfoData </span></h4>
<p>Variable adjusted by the channel in the context of entry, from information received by the ISDN network functionality through user-to-User Information. Contains the actual data, which were received in the form of a string of text.
</p><p>More information about this feature, see the specification ITU-T Q931.
</p><p>Example (working with the data received):
<!-- NEED 3 -->
</p>
<pre>&lt;action application="log" data="DEBUG KUserInfoData [${KUserInfoData}]"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>It is important to note that the variables are sensitive to the capitalization of letters (case sensitive).
</p>
<a name="KCallAnswerInfo" id="KCallAnswerInfo"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> KCallAnswerInfo </span></h4>
<p>Variable adjusted by the Endpoint. It is set in outbound connections, representing the type of answer performed by the other end. May contain the following values:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li> "MessageBox" (*): detected mailbox of a cell phone;
</li><li> "CarrierMessage": message sent before the service provider;
</li><li> "AnsweringMachine" (**): answering answering machine;
</li><li> "HumanAnswer" (**): human service;
</li><li> "Fax": reported when a fax tone is detected.
</li><li> "Unknown": unknown type of care;
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<p>(*) This type of service is detected by signals at certain frequencies that are sent before the call comes into a mailbox, and vary by operator. The algorithm captures most of the mailboxes, but can fail if there is not a clear signal, or if it is not within the standards most commonly used;
</p><p>(**) The difference between these two types of care depends on the specific configuration using the program <b>k3lanswerinfoconfig</b>, with the detection only based on heuristics and <b>never</b> with an accuracy of 100%.

<p>This communication channel is used to receive SMS and create incoming links in FreeSWITCH for each message received. This channel does not have any treatment or audio processing, and is called with five variables set:
</p>
<ul><li><b>KSmsFrom</b>, containing the number of source who sent the message;
</li><li><b>KSmsDate</b>, which sets the date/time of receipt of the message;
</li><li><b>KSmsSize</b>, representing the message size (in bytes);
</li><li><b>KSmsMode</b>, containing the encoding used to transmit the message;
</li><li><b>KSmsBody</b>, that is the message itself.
</li></ul>
<p>The FreeSWITCH dialplan processing can be used to store this message in a database, run any application, among others. However, the only action accepted by this channel is shutdown (Hangup), so this incoming call should be considered a special dialplan execution without audio streams or channel allocation.

This channel allows only receiving audio captured the <i>link</i>by not allowing both the transmission of audio signalings as the control.
</p><p>The FreeSWITCH dialplan processing can be used to record data on this link in a database, perform some special application and/or some recording application (such as <b>record</b>), among others. However, the only action accepted by this channel is shutdown (Hangup), so this should not be considered a common call.

</pre>
<p>In this case, you must compile the drivers manually to your system. Proceed to the item below for more information.

<a name="Compiling_the_drivers_and_starting_the_services" id="Compiling_the_drivers_and_starting_the_services"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Compiling the drivers and starting the services </span></h3>
<p>Just follow to the directory <b>/usr/src/khomp</b>, unpack the file "kpdriver_2.0.0<b>XX</b>.tar.gz", and follow procedures described in the file <b>README_en.txt</b>.
</p><p>After performing compilation and installation of the module, just load it into the system, configuring the boards and start the server processes Khomp.
</p><p>To load the kernel driver, you must run the following command:
<!-- NEED 3 --> 
</p>
<pre># /etc/init.d/khompdrv start
</pre>
<p>To set up the boards, in turn, must run the command:
<!-- NEED 3 --> 
</p>
<pre># khompwizard
</pre>
<p>This will run a setup wizard that will ask the signaling used in the system, as well as other parameters of use of the boards.
</p><p>If necessary configure other additional parameters you can use the following command:
<!-- NEED 3 --> 
</p>
<pre># k3lconfig
</pre>
<p>This configurator, in turn, shows all possible options for card configuration. The parameters that are not configured automatically assume the default values, and are compatible with most systems. More details about this program can be obtained from the section number '2 '.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>ATTENTION</b>: To start FreeSWITCH&reg;, it is necessary that the Khomp board is configured and all modules are running (as shown above). <br /> <br /> If you want to run the system without the Khomp board, you need to configure FreeSWITCH for it does not load the module Khomp. To do this, open the <b>/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs/modules.conf.xml</b> and comment the line:<br />
</li></ul>
<pre> 
&lt;!-- &lt;load module=&quot;mod_khomp&quot; /&gt; --&gt;
</pre><br /> 
<p>When the board Khomp is properly configured and loaded modules khomp (explained above), remember to uncomment this line in the file.
</p><p>Finally, to load the server process, simply run the following command:
<!-- NEED 3 -->
</p>
<pre># kserver start
</pre>
<p>After performing these procedures, the Endpoint is already operational, and FreeSWITCH can now be loaded.

<p>To set specific parameters of timing and/or signaling, you can use the program "k3lconfig": simply select the card you want, and options of the boards will be presented, divided into sections and subsections for easy access. It is not necessary to effect the configuration of all parameters: default values are assumed, if not configured.
</p><p>To adjust the signaling link, simply - after selecting the card - enter the "Options signaling, and then in" Signs of the line. " To choose a particular signaling, just use the direction keys (arrows) to select it, press 'space', and confirm the option by pressing 'Enter' on the "Confirm" button.
</p><p>Finally, to save the modified settings, just exit the program: it will display a window with options to save the changes made or not.
</p><p>Please not that <b>the following options are required to be unchanged from the defaults</b>:
</p>
<ul><li> Automatic echo cancellation;
</li><li> DTMF suppression;
