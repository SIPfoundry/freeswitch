Enable/disable generalized echo cancellation in the channel, for calls
passing inside FreeSWITCH (disabled for bridged calls).
(default = yes)

can make line noise really loud.
(default = yes)

<param name="auto-gain-control" value="yes"/>

behaviour for condition obtaining/reporting.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; CONTEXTS WILDCARDS ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For incoming contexts, you can use the following wildcards:

'DD' (device number): the sequence number of the board on the
system (can be checked using "khomp summary", valid for all
board models);

'LL' (link number): the sequence number of link where the call
has arrived on the board. valid only for E1 boards.

'SSSS' (serial number): the serial number of the board (can
be checked using "khomp summary", and it's valid for all
board models);

'CC' (channel number): the channel number on which the call
or message has arrived (valid for FXO, FXS and GSM boards);

'CCC' (channel number): same as above, but valid only for E1
channels;
-->

<!--  Section for configuring allocation groups. -->
<groups>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

<groupname> = <allocation-string>[:<context>]

<param name="pstn" value="b0l0 + b1c38"/>
<param name="pstn" value="b0l0 + b1c38:from-pstn"/>

You may define your own groups. In the example above, the group 
called pstn can be used in the bridge string as <action application="brigde" data="Khomp/Gpstn/..." />
or <action application="brigde" data="Khomp/Gpstn/..." />. As a result, the allocation string will be
replaced with the one associated with the group "pstn". This is the same
of doing <action application="brigde" data="Khomp/b0l0 + b1c38/... />.
In the second example, a context is also defined which can be used in
extensions.conf for inbound calls on that allocation string's range.

</groups>

<!--
Section for configuring cadences used on FXS boards and the whole
channel (fast busy, ringback tones, etc).
-->
<cadences>
<!--
Default value for cadences. You may define your own cadences, and
also use them in the bridge arguments as "cadence=your_cadence_name".

 "0,0" means a continuous dialtone.

 (default as defined below)
 <param name="fast-busy" value="100,100" />
 <param name="ringback" value="1000,4000" />
 <param name="pbx-dialtone" value="1000,100" />
 <param name="vm-dialtone " value="1000,100,100,100" />
 <param name="co-dialtone " value="0,0" />
-->
</cadences>


<!-- Section for configuring CALLERID's associated with FXS boards. -->
<fxs-branches>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

'orig_prefix = serial number 0, serial number 1, ...'

ex: <param name="880" value="111,222"/>

In the example above (assuming KFXS-SPX boards 1234 and 4535), the
branches will be numbered from 800 to 829 in board 1234, and from
830 to 859 in board 4535.
-->
</fxs-branches>

<!-- Section for configuring FXS hotlines. -->
<fxs-hotlines>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

'orig_prefix = destination_number'

ex: <param name="804" value="32332933" />

In the example above, the branch numbered 804 will call the number
3233-2933 (Khomp support number) every time the FXS branch goes off hook.
-->
</fxs-hotlines>

<!-- Section for configuring specific options for FXS branches. -->
<fxs-options>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

orig_prefix = option1:value | option2:value | option3:value ...

ex: <param name="804" value="output-volume:+2" />

In the example above, the branch numbered 804 will have specific
configuration for default output volume set to +2.

Possible values to options is:
context, input-volume, output-volume, language,
accountcode, calleridnum, calleridname, flash-to-digits.
