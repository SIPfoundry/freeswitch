GSMopen, GSM Endpoint and Trunk

This is just a prototype.

put this directory in freeswitch.trunk/src/mod/endpoints/

make clean; make; make install

Is not getting its configuration from the configuration file, it's all hardcoded but it needs the configuration file.

Copy gsmopen.conf.xml in /usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs/

You must have the device on serial port /dev/ttyACM0 and the audio as second soundcard plughw:1 (if you do not have a first soundcard, just modprobe snd-dummy before to connect the usb thingy).

Put the volumes (with alsamixer -c1 -Vall) as: speaker 80, autogain on, mic off, mic capt 0. 

Then, with alsamixer -c1 -Vcapture, be sure capture is active (eg, press the spacebar until the red CAPTURE appear). When it all working, adjust to your taste.

It answer calls, make calls, receive sms, and send sms (with the CLI command "sendsms").

Copy ciapalo in /usr/local/bin/ (is the program automatically spawned when an SMS is received).

Copy asound.conf in /etc/asound.conf, it will spare you cpu cycles when rate conversion is required (always).

tricks and tweaks, possible problems at:
