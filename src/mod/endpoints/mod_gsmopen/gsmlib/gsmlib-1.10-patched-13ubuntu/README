INTRODUCTION

     This distribution contains a library to access GSM mobile phones
     through GSM modems or IrDA devices. Features include:

     * modification of phonebooks stored in the mobile phone or on the 
       SIM card

     * reading and writing of SMS messages stored in the mobile phone

     * sending and reception of SMS messages

     Additionally, some simple command line programs are provided to
     use these functionalities.


REQUIREMENTS

     You need a mobile phone that conforms to the GSM
     standards ETSI GSM 07.07, ETSI GSM 07.05, and others.
     Non-GSM mobile phones will not work! Additionally,
     to access the mobile phone from the computer you will probably need an 
     GSM modem (that would be a PC-CARD, usually). There might be some
     mobile phones, however, that incorporate directly terminal
     adapter (TA) functionality. Access via IrDA interfaces is also
     reported to work.

     If you want to compile the library yourself please also read
     doc/README.developers.


INSTALLATION

     This distribution uses autoconf/automake/libtool. See the file
     INSTALL for generic installation instructions. The default
     commands for installation under /usr/local would be:

       ./configure
       make
       make install

     If there are any problems you can generate a debug version. See
     doc/README.developers for details.


AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION

     For the command line tools UNIX manual pages are available in the 
     doc subdirectory of this distribution. These are installed by
     default in the directories /usr/local/man1, man7, and man8.

     See also the files doc/README.developers, doc/README.NLS and doc/FAQ.


HARDWARE
     
     The following mobile phone/GSM modem combinations are reported to
     be compatible in varying degrees with the current release:
  
     - Nokia 6150/Xircom REM56G.100
     - Nokia 6150/Options "GSM-Ready(R) Cellular-Only" modem
       from Option International

     - Siemens S35i/- (Linux IrDA serial device)
     - Siemens S45
     - Ericcson SH888/- (Linux IrDA serial device)
     - Ericsson 6050102/GM 12 GSM module
     - Ericsson T28s (firmware 000809 1106)
     - Ericsson T20e (firmware R3A007)

     - Nokia Card Phone RPM-1 GSM900/1800
     - Nokia Cardphone/Compaq iPAQ
     - Omnipoint technologies Redhawk 2000 GSM modem
     - Ericsson T28 (but one firmware revision is reported to have problems)
     - Ericcson T65
     - Ericcson T39m/Bluetooth
     - Option International GlobeTrotter PCMCIA

     Note 1: Some of the mobile phones have an integrated GSM modem
     that can be accessed via the Linux IrDA drivers.

     Note 2: Some of the abovementioned phones have still some glitches
     with gsmlib (and I haven't tested them myself).

     For the following phones I receive a lot of errors reports:

     - Ericcson SH888: SMS function don't work with many firmware releases

     This list is not exhaustive, there are probably many other types of
     phone or GSM modem that work with gsmlib. Just try it and report back
     to me!


DISCLAIMER

     Even though care has been taken in the design and implementation
     of this software it can not be excluded that this software could
     destroy data in your mobile phone or may even render your mobile
     phone useless (by erroneous PIN settings, for example). The

     other form for any kind of damage that might occur from using
     this software.

COPYING

     PUBLIC LICENSE), ie. it is allowed to link 
     the library to commercial programs.

     See the file COPYING for details on the license.


BUGS

     There still seem to be some problems with IrDA devices under
     Linux. There have been reports of gsmlib-based applications
     (eg. gsmctl) hanging upon startup after initializing the serial port
     /dev/ircomm. I would be thankful for any input on this problem.

     If something does not work with your OS platform or the mobile/TA
     combination please send a complete trace of the compilation or the
     program execution that did fail. Make sure to compile with debugging 
     information enabled. Otherwise it will not be possible for me to do
     much about the problem. Send bug reports to the mailing list or
     to software@pxh.de. I promise not to publish telephone numbers or other 
     private information that might be contained in the execution traces
     that you send me.
