Following list not in priority order.

1. Determine if a new instance is needed for each independant inbound stream, or if a global instance can handle all inbound and outbound streams
2. Look into libvlc imem and determine if it is possible to stream parts of a call at a time, or if imem requires all of the buffer to be loaded.
      a. Add and confirm stream over network functionality
      b. Add and confirm stream to file
      c. Confirm transcode works to mp3, wav, aac, etc.
3. Test multiple concurrent listeners to the same stream. 
      a. Look into have a single libvlc thread stream the file and write to the audio buffer, and multiple readers
      b. Test multiple input streams simultaniously
      c. Load test multiple requests(both multiple to the same stream, and multiple unique streams) to look for issues
4. Enable proper seeking support
5. Add video support
6. Confirm streaming from file works on differnt sample rates. 8k, 16k, etc.
