How to Give Back to the FreeSWITCH Community
============================================

You're found FreeSWITCH to be helpful to you in accomplishing your
goals.  How can you give back to the project?

Like many community projects, FreeSWITCH lives on volunteers, money,
and enthusiasm.

Example: You work for a large company
-------------------------------------

If your company uses FreeSWITCH in any capacity, it makes sense for
people at your company to be familiar with it.  The best way for this
to happen is to get involved with the development, documentation, and
administration of the project.  See if your company will pay for
yourself or others to spend a part of their time contributing to
FreeSWITCH.

When your company has a specific need FreeSWITCH can meet, consider
developing the feature in such a way that the majority of it can be
pushed up to us as a new module or subsystem and benefit others.

If you need a feature developed in a hurry, or done the "right way" in
FreeSWITCH, consider contracting one of the core developers.

As your company depends on FreeSWITCH, push internally for the company
to subscribe to a support agreement with FreeSWITCH Solutions so the
company receives priority support.

Encourage your company to sponsor ClueCon; in addition to helping out
the project, you'll be exposed to a great pool of people to partner
with, sell to, and recruit from.
